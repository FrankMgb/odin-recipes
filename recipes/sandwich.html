    <p>Cook for up to 3 minutes or until the whites are firm and the yolk runny. Just before eggs are cooked, place a slice of cheese over each egg.
         Make sure not to flip the fried eggs or press it down otherwise you will break the yolk.
        Once the cheese has melted,Â it's time to assemble the sandwich. Spread the mayonnaise on the buttered, toasted bread. 
        Next, add the salad, a toasted bread slice and spread again the mayonnaise. Add the cooked bacon, fried egg topped with 
        melted cheese and close the sandwich with another bread slice. Slice and serve</p>
