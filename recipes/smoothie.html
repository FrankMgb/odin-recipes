    <p>Place all ingredients in the order listed above in a high speed blender and puree until smoothie and creamy.
        You may need to add more liquid if your blender is not powerful enough to handle all these frozen ingredients.
         If possible, try to keep it to 1 Â¼ cup of liquid for a thicker and creamier smoothie. You may want to add a 
         handful of ice to make it frostier or additional frozen blueberries to make the color extra purple.</p>
