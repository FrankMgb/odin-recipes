    <p>Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan. Stir in 2 cups oats and Â¾ teaspoon each kosher salt and cinnamon.
        Reduce the heat to medium. Cook for about 6 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until creamy and the liquid is mostly absorbed.
        Remove from the heat and let stand for 2 minutes, which allows more liquid to be absorbed. The standing time is important, 
        in order to get to the perfect texture of oats!</p>
